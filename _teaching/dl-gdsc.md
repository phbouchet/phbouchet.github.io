As a Deep Learning Lead in the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) at EPITA, I led an introductory workshop to demystify deep learning concepts. The workshop aimed to equip interested students with the foundational knowledge needed to deepen their understanding of the field.

To facilitate hands-on learning, I created a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that guided participants through the creation of a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for natural image classification. The notebook provided clear and simple step-by-step explanations, making the complex concepts accessible to all.
