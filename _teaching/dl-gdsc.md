As a Deep Learning Lead in the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) at EPITA, I led an introductory workshop to demystify deep learning concepts. The workshop aimed to equip interested students with the foundational knowledge needed to deepen their understanding of the field.

To facilitate hands-on learning, I created a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that guided participants through the creation of a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for natural image classification. The notebook provided clear and simple step-by-step explanations, making the complex concepts accessible to all.

The workshop material can be found [here](https://github.com/GDSC-EPITA/gdsc-deep_learning_intro-epita/blob/master/GDSC_DL_notebook.ipynb).

During my time as a student at EPITA, I had the opportunity to join the Google Developer Student Club, as a deep learning lead. As a member of the GDSC, I led an introductory workshop to deep learning. The workshop was there to give people who are interested in deep learning a starting point to provide them with the necessary knowledge to deepen their understanding of the field. To this end, I wrote a [jupyter notebook]() with step-by-step explanations to a basic CNN model for classification. The presentation can be found [here]
