I currently a research intern at [Lunit](https://lunit.io), supervised by [Dr. Hyungseob Shin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=b-B-sxcAAAAJ). I am working on improving risk prediction models dedicated to detecting breast cancer in mammograms.

I obtained my *diplôme d'ingénieur* from EPITA in 2023 where I specialized in deep learning for medical purposes.
Previously, I worked with [Dr. Edwin Carlinet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vey3EPkAAAAJ&hl=en) on mathematical morphology for medical image annotation. I also worked with [Dr. Nicolas Boutry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hU-3BxkAAAAJ&hl=en) on a novel method for brain tumor segmentation. I was also a research intern at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us) in Princeton, where I worked on deep learning methods for cardiovascular tasks.
